    <h1> Adrenaline Rush </h1>
    <p> The weight of the world is on your shoulders. You don't have any time. With that being said,
        you charge into the castle with an embarrasingly loud warcry and run up the stairs to the lair 
        of the dragon. The end is near; you can feel it. You burst through the gates of where the dragon is 
        locked up. In a frenzy, you charge straight for it. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        The dragon spots you as you charge at it with an iron blade. In the blink of an eye, you're 
        immediately knocked back and faceplant into the ground. You're barely able to duck your head as 
        a hurling ring of fire surrounds you. It's looking like <b> you should've came up with a plan</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, maybe the journey was the friends you made along the way. The past decisions you made. The paths
        you took. Maybe they would come save you now...
