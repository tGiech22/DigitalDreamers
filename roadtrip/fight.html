    <h1> Fight the bandits!! </h1>
        <p> 
            You're overwhelemed by the number of bandits that are soon surrounding you and aren't sure exactly what to do. You think 
            you're strong enough to go right back at them, but you have a gut feeling that you should keep other options in mind. 
            After contemplating for a bit, you narrow it down to two choices: <b> using brute force tactics </b> or <b> using a 
            strategic tactic </b>. Which do you go with?

            <div class = "container">
                <button class="button button1"> Brute force tactics </button>
                <button class="button button1"> Strategic tactics </button>
            </div>
</body>
