    <h1> Congratulations! You saved your kingdom! </h1>
        <p> It seems like luck is on your side today. You successfully manage to dodge the dragon's attacks 
            towards you and do a heroic lunge and sling your blade straight into its heart. It staggers back 
        and roars ferociously as it collapses into its own pit of lava. </p>
        <p> 
            A second of silence passes before relief flows into your heart. You did it.
            You saved your people and the kingdom. Whether it was luck or the chances of your 
            past decisions, you saved the day. 
        </p>
