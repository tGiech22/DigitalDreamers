    <h1> Bandits at 12:00! </h1>
    <p> You emerge out of the road and thank whatever being is out there for escaping. 
        You think that you're finally out of trouble now and the hard bump in the road
        has passed. Well... YOU'RE WRONG! You hear collective shouting and storm of aggressive 
        footsteps come directly in front of you. A war cry is heard and you're thinking this is the end.
        But... it's only a group of bandits. Nonetheless, you're <b> fight or flight </b> kicks in.
