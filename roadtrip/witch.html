    <h1> A bewitching encounter </h1>
        <p> You muster up the courage and decide to confront the witch. You clear your throat
            and she slowly turns around to acknowledge you. Her crooked teeth twist into a sickening
        smile as if she was expecting you. She opens her mouth to speak and the most unsettling voice
        fills the air. </p>
        <p> "<i> Come my child, </i>" she says. "<i>Take my hand. You look unwell</i>". </p>
        <p> As if in a trance, you take her hand. Big mistake. A nearly fatal shock runs through your
            body when you make contact and she cackles as smoke fills the air. You cough and as it disappears
            so does she...You're left all alone now with nothing but the burning pain on your hand.
