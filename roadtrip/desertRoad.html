    <h1> You're all alone with nothing in sight... </h1>
        <p> You end up roaming what seems like a deserted road with nothing but your own self-- no source of light, no safety device, 
            not even a sense of direction. So far, you've kept calm and plan on continuing to do so. Taking small steps at a time, you
            make your way forward. All you hear are your footsteps below you... or so you thought. 
            From the distance, you hear eary cackling and you freeze. The laughter approaches you and you see a short but mighty looking 
            witch with an evil smirk coming your way. Your two choices are to <b> interact with the witch </b> or <b> ignore and walk 
            around her, pretending you never even noticed her. </b> What do you do? </p>
            <div class = "container">
                <button class="button button1"> Interact with the witch </button>
                <button class="button button1"> Ignore and walk around </button>
            </div>
