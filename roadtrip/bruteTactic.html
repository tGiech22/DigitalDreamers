    <h1> Brute Force Tactics </h1>
        <p> With bandits circling around you leaving not even small crevices for wind to pass through, 
            you instantly start to get nervous. Still, you trust your instincts and decide to gather courage. </p>
        <p> <i> I totally got this. Just go for it! </i> </p>
        <p> You run towards a handful of bandits with all your strength with overflowing confidence. </p>
        <p> <i> Pow! Ouch! Ow...</i></p>
        <p> You open your eyes and realize your on the ground. You've been defeated after your first attempt.
            Embarrased, you crawl up into a ball until you sense all the bandits leaving the scene...
