    <h1> It's time to enter the castle!</h1>
    <p> You decide it's smartest to plan your entrance into the castle.
        Seeing the damage that's been done, you need to make sure your presence doesn't make it worse.
        Keeping in mind that this is your territory and you have make a powerful entrance, but also one 
        that doesn't create further unnecessary chaos. </p>
    <p> <i> Whoosh-- you push the front doors and reveal the inside </i> </p>
    <p> You weave in and out through the hallways with stealth. Your footsteps are as light as a feather.
        As you tip-toe into the dungeon where the dragons lays sound asleep. You stealthy moves
        help you move closer towards the dragon and they don't wake him up.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Has luck finally caught up onto you? Or have the decisions of your past clung onto you...
