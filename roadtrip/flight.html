    <h1> To flee or not to flee</h1>
    <p> You decide to sprint away as fast as possible. Unfortunately for you, while you were too 
        busy thinking about fleeing, the bandits circled you. You're unable to dodge them in time
        and get a hit straight in the face...Bull's eye! That black eye doesn't seem like it's going 
        to be going anywhere anytime soon and neither are the bandits. You have no choice but to try
        and stand your ground until they disappear into the night. You are <b> badly bruised</b>.
