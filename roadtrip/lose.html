        <p> Whether it was because of fate, or luck, or your lack of hygiene, you were unable to 
            defeat the dragon. By a fatal error in your movement, the dragon was able to swing its tail
            under your feet, sending you into a tumbling mess straight into the lava. 
        </p>
        <p> You were unable to save yourself, your kingdomw, and your people. </p>
