    <h1> The darkness shrouds your vision </h1>
    <p> The second you enter the forest, you immediately feel as if you chose the wrong path.
        Your fears are only amplified when eyes seem to follow you in the dark. The slightest 
        noise makes you jump. You duck your head as you try to dodge the cold wind that
        whistles past your neck. Eventually, you are led to a glowing brightness. You squint your eyes
        in confusion and you nearly pass out as you realize that it's a <b> spirit</b>. Do you
        <b> approach it</b> or simply <b> try to dodge </b> the spirit.
