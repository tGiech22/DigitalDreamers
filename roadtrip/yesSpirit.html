        <p> You decide to chance nature and walk up to the spirit. As you approach it, 
            it slowly turns its floating body to face you. A shiver runs down your spine
        as you make eye contact with its empty eyes. You're starting to think that maybe
        this wasn't the right decision. Before you think more, it opens its hands and a feeling
    of peace and healing washes over your body. As you open your mouth to thank it, it disappears in 
    a flash and you slowly and quietly proceed to walk through the forest. </p>
