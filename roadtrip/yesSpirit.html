        <p> And thus, you begin your journey. As you trudge your way to the 
        castle, you encounter an obstacle. Your vision starts to blur from fatigue
        and you start to lose feelings in your feet. But the show must go on. 
        So despite this, you travel on. As you continue to walk, you discover a fork
        in the road. You discover two paths. On the left, <b>a dark and mysterious forest</b> that makes you
        shiver in fear. On the right, <b> a seemingly deserted road</b> that shows no sign of life. </p>
