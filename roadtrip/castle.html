    <h1> You've arrived at the castle </h1>
        <p> After a long, tiring journey, you finally start to see the tip of the castle's roof. You strut towards it with mixed emotions.
            You get closer to the castle with each step, gradually getting a wave of mixed emotions. At last, you're standing in front of 
            the doors-- all you have to do now is enter. Your two choices are to <b> plan your entrance </b> or <b> barge into the castle. </p>
            <p class="p2"> 
                Which do you choose?
            </p>
